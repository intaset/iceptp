<h1>File Format Check Module for OpenConf</h1>
<p>This module verifies whether an uploaded file matches the selected format.  Instead of relying on the file extension or browser-provided MIME type, at least for the formats below, the file itself is inspected to determine its format through signature matching.  If a signature is not available, the file extension is checked instead.</p>
<p>Signature checking is currently available for the following:<br />
<ul>
<li>Adobe PDF</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>Microsoft Word</li>
<li>PostScript</li>
<li>RTF</li>
<li>WordPerfect</li>
<li>XML</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>none</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>Options are provided in this module's settings that allow excluding Office (2007) Open XML documents (.docx) and RTF documents from being accepted as Word documents.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>When a file is uploaded, the detected file format is automatically verified against the selected  format.  If the format does not match, the upload will not be completed and a notice is displayed.</p>
