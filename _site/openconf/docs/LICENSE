This license is a legal Agreement between you and Zakon Group LLC for use of the OpenConf Software (the "Software").  By downloading or installing OpenConf or any OpenConf modules you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this license.  Zakon Group LLC reserves the right to alter this agreement at any time, for any reason, without notice.

PERMITTED USE

- Community License: Users of the Community License may use the Software only on their own web site and if no payment is made or received in connection with the Software or related services.  If you need a third party to install, customize, or administer OpenConf, or you wish to provide such services to a third party, an OpenConf License must be purchased.

- Plus and Professional Licenses: Upon payment of the license fee to and issuance of the license by Zakon Group LLC, a single installation of the licensed Software with embedded license key may be made by the licensee or its designated agent.  One license grants the right to perform one installation of the Software to be used for the event the license was purchased for.  Each additional installation of the Software requires an additional purchased license.  An event is defined as constituting a single submission cycle.  Recurring events (e.g., quarterly, annual), or ones with separately-managed tracks, require a license for each instance.  Components of the Professional Edition Software may not be copied to other installations, whether they are licensed or not.  New submissions may not be accepted after a license has expired.
