 INSTALL

1. Download the OpenConf software archive and extract (unzip) files 
   into the Web server document root directory, maintaining the
   OpenConf sub-directory structure.

2. Ensure Web server can create or write to:
    openconf/config.php
    openconf/data/   (and sub-directories)

3. Browse to http://[HOST]/openconf/ and follow web instructions.

See www.OpenConf.com/support/ for additional documentation.

 ETCETERA / TROUBLESHOOTING
============================

- Email is handled through PHP's mail() function.  If email is not being
  received or you are seeing an error, check and test your PHP settings.

- OpenConf does not limit the size of files that may be uploaded;
  PHP however does.  You will need to modify PHP's max file and form upload
  settings if you want to support larger files being uploaded; do not forget
  to restart the HTTP server when you update PHP settings.

- If you are uncomfortable having a file (config.php) with the database
  password inside the Web document space, you can move it elsewhere
  and simply modify the OCC_CONFIG_FILE define in include.php.
  
- In order to use OpenConf's multilingual capability, PHP must be compiled 
   with gettext, and the system have the proper locale(s) installed.
   See lib/locale/locale.inc for appropriate locales.
   
- If you are running multiple instances of OpenConf, you must ensure the
  value of OCC_SESSION_VAR_NAME in config.php is different for each in order
  to prevent cross-instance access.
